# estate-management-system
It's a project I developed to reinforce the structures on C# that I learned in a programming course at the university. I used SHA-256 encryption algorithm for Login and Register operations; I preferred MSSQL as database; I also used Visual Studio 2017 as the IDE.


Structures required for installation and execute:

Visual Studio 17
MsSQL
You must make the information about the database the same as the information in the ServerConnection class file inside the file, or you must define a new database and write this information in the code pages.
