# estate-management-system
It's a project I developed to reinforce the structures on C# that I learned in a programming course at the university. I used SHA-256 encryption algorithm for Login and Register operations; I preferred MSSQL as database; I also used Visual Studio 2017 as the IDE.


Structures required for installation and execute:

Eclipse IDE
Java SE 17
MySQL Connector 8.0.29
JavaFX SDK 18.0.1
For Database: AMPPS
Run Configuration - Arguments: --module-path "C:\Users\furkan\jdk\javafx-sdk-18.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
After //--module-path you need to point the path of lib folder of sdk 18.0.1.
